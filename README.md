I'm a Data Analyst with a background in Biostatistics. Right now, I'm expanding my skills by joining a Data Science Bootcamp, learning more about data analytics, visualization, and machine learning. I also work on personal data projects, exploring different datasets and building dashboards to find useful insights.

In my free time, I enjoy creating illustrations as a way to balance analysis with creativity ðŸŽ¨
